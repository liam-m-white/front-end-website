# ReadMe

This repository contains:

1. [Data](data) in JSON format, used on multiple pages.
2. [Images](images) used across the site.
3. [Pages](pages) written in HTML5.
4. [Scripts](scripts) containing [global.js](scripts/global.js), the javascript for all pages.
5. [Styles](styles) containing [styles.css](styles/styles.css), the css for all pages.
6. [Index](index.html) written in HTML5. This is here instead of in [Pages](pages) so that Live Server knows to serve that page.
3. [ReadMe](readme.md). That's me!

## Background

This project was originally for the CTEC3905 Front-End Web Development module at De Montfort University. It is the coursework that results in 100% of my mark for this module, worth 15 credits.

I intend to use this as a portfolio site.

## Usage

This project was intened to be used for my CTEC3905 coursework.

It was expected to be used with the vsCode Live Server extension.

I plan on creating a live site using Netlify.
