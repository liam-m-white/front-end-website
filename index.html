          Hi there! My name is <span class="highlight">Liam White</span>, and I am a 22-year-old <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span> student studying at De Montfort University, Leicester. I've always been interested in technology and the way it can be used to solve complex problems, which is why I chose to study Computer Science.
          At De Montfort, I have been able to learn from knowledgeable and experienced professors who have been able to deepen my understanding of may different aspects of Computing. The coursework is challenging, but it is also very rewarding. I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, involving 
          <span class="highlight">Object Oriented Development</span>, <span class="highlight">Web Application Development</span>, <span class="highlight">Database Design and Implementation</span>, and much more.
          Overall, I feel that De Montfort University has provided me with an excellent education and the resources I need to achieve my goals. I am excited about the future and the opportunities that await me in the field of Computer Science.

        <p>
          As a final year Computer Science student at De Montfort University (DMU), I have found the experience to be enriching and challenging in equal measure.

        </div>
        <p>
          One of my interests is spending time with my  6 month old Staffordshire Bull Terrier, <span class="highlight">Monty</span>. He's a lovable and loyal dog that always keeps me on my toes. I enjoy spending time with him, taking him for walks and training him with a variety of commands.
          <br><br>
          Another interest of mine is <span class="highlight">rocket engineering</span>. I love learning about the science and technology behind space travel, and I'm always fascinated by the latest developments in the field. I often watch livestreams of launches, and am particularly keen on following the development of <span class="highlight">SpaceX</span>'s Starship/SuperHeavy launch vehicle.
          <br><br>
          I also enjoy <span class="highlight">boxing</span>. I keep up with several fighters and regularly train on the pads, and with my heavy bag in the garage.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, I enjoy gaming in my free time. It's always exciting to explore new worlds and take on new challenges in virtual environments. I don't often have much time to do this anymore, but when I do open-world games such as Skyrim are my favourites. (I'm also not too bad at Tetris!)
